                    <p> My name is Mackenzie Bauer and I am a recent University of Alberta graduate with a major in computer science and a minor in mathematics. I am dedicated, fast learner, and I am truly excited to start my career!
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, I completed over half of my degree requirements through online learning due to the pandemic, but I believe that challenge has given me all the right skills to persevere through any task. 
                        Currently, my interests lie in software development, robotics, and artificial intelligence, but I am open to any opportunity that allows me to gain more experience. Each day I am amazed by the advancement of technology and I am more excited than ever to finally get to work in industry. 
                        <br><br>
                        I also am a huge hockey fan (go Oilers), enjoy coaching a multitude of sports, and I love to volunteer when possible!
